## 1. Introduction

This Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) defines which checks need to happen when an end user reports a disclosure incident. In a
nutshell a disclosure incident occurs when personally identifiable information (PII) is discovered in the 
Trusted Research Environment (TRE) by end users not authorised to work with identifiable patient data. Further information and examples for disclosure incidents can be found
in the [disclosure policy](../policies/disclosure-incidents.md). 

## 2. Pre-requisites

The purpose of this SOP is to ensure that end users of the TRE understand their role in reporting unintended disclosure events of PII that 
may (albeit with a low likelihood) happen in the automatic provision of data.

## 3. Procedure

Note that logging an incident will trigger [SOP 7](./UCLH_SOP_0007.md) immediately.

## 4. Implementation and training

This procedure will be shared with those seeking access to the FlowEHR TRE. It will also be shared as part of the end user 
documentation through the GitHub repository that is mirrored to the Gitea service inside the TRE.
