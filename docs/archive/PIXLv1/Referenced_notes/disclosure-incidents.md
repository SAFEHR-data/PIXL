# Disclosures


## Introduction 

While great care has been taken when anonymising patient relevant data, all methods applied are automated and hence personally identifiable 
information (PII) may be revealed accidentally. In cases where PII is discovered either through end user or the TRE providers, the instances of data
will need to be reported (following [SOP 6](UCLH_SOP_0006.md)).

### Examples of PPI 

1. Names, e.g. "Sophia Andrews" or "S. Andrews"
2. Date of birth or dates of specific investigations, including partial dates, e.g. "21/02/22" or "21/02"
3. Ethnic group information in Dicom images

If in doubt whether or not PPI may have leaked outside the hospital compute infrastructure, please reach out to the TRE team to decide the best 
progress moving forward.


## Responsibilities

Once an incident has been reported, an assessment of the severity needs to be made and appropriate steps taken to mitigate risks around the 
disclosure. This will likely involve following up with the Information Governance team and a potential data breach reporting procedure.

Furthermore, it is important to assess how the data propagated to the end user and any steps for prevention in the future need to be identified and
executed, if it cannot be excluded that the behaviour constituted an exception.
