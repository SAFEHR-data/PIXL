# PIXL Image eXtraction Laboratory

## Summary

`PIXL` is a system for extracting, linking and de-identifying DICOM imaging data, structured EHR data and free-text data from radiology reports at UCLH.

The initial aim is to prove the concept of ingestion and processing of linked multi modal data into a useful and secure environment in the cloud which enables medical imaging ML research at scale.

The follow-on ambition is to progress from retrospective research and harness linked imaging data for innovation through direct improvement in patient care and increased efficiency in the health system.

Initial effort is focused on building an [MVP](MVP.md) to serve a single use case.
The UCLH and Microsoft Research collaboration includes the NGT-CXR "Radiology Co-pilot" project which will act as our exemplar. See the [Research Programme Plan](https://github.com/UCLH-DIF/Book-of-FlowEHR/blob/main/artefacts/UCLH_MSR_Research_Programme_Plan_COPY_12_09_2022.docx) for further details about this project.

The `PIXL` [MVP](MVP.md) forms part of [_The Tracer Bullet_](https://github.com/UCLH-DIF/Book-of-FlowEHR/blob/main/milestones/tracer-bullet/README.md) (TTB) MVP for [FlowEHR](https://github.com/UCLH-DIF/Book-of-FlowEHR), UCLH's cloud research & innovation infrastructure initiative.
