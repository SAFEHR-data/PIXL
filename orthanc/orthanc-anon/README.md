# Orthanc Anon

_The Orthanc instance responsible for anonymising DICOM data from PACS/VNA and forwarding the images
to their final destination (currently the UCL Data Safe Haven)._

## Setup

### Prerequisites

The following assumptions are made:

- `Orthanc Raw` is operational and auto-routing is configured to send data from `Raw` to `Anon`.
- The [`Hasher API`](../../hasher/README.md) is available.
- A running FTPS server, as defined in [`pixl_core`](../../pixl_core/README.md), is available to receive the anonymised data
- There is sufficient local storage for the `orthanc-anon-data` volume.

<details><summary>In case the final destination is an Azure Dicom service:</summary>

- The Azure AD`Tenant ID`, `App ID` and `Client Secret` have been configured.
- The Azure DICOM service endpoint is available and has been configured.
- Outbound HTTPS access to the Azure DICOM service is available.

</details>

### Configuration

- The Docker image is based on `orthancteam/orthanc`.
- Configuration is driven through customised JSON config. files stored in the [config](./config/)
directory.
- The files are populated with values from environment variables and injected into the container as
secrets. Orthanc interprets all `.json` files in the `/run/secrets` mount as config. files.
- The instance configuration comprises three files:
  - `dicom.json` - Controls the AE Title for this instance, the details of the `Raw` instance and
  the config stub for DICOMWeb (to enable configuration of the Azure DICOM service at runtime).
  - `orthanc.json` - Controls the instance name, RBAC, storage and enabling plugins. (Plugins are
  required to enable the Python plugins)
- The anonymisation is carried out by an Orthanc Python plugin [pixl.py](./plugin/pixl.py). This
plugin uses the [pixl_dcmd](../../pixl_dcmd/) package to apply the anonymisation scheme (and that
in turn uses [Kitware Dicom Anonymizer](https://github.com/KitwareMedical/dicom-anonymizer))
- Environmental variables:
  - `PIXL_DICOM_TRANSFER_TIMEOUT` is used as the timeout for any REST API requests made from
        orthanc-anon

### Step 1

Save credentials `.env` for 'Orthanc anon' and the Azure DICOM Service.

```
# PIXL Orthanc anon instance
ORTHANC_ANON_USERNAME=
ORTHANC_ANON_PASSWORD=
ORTHANC_ANON_AE_TITLE=
ORTHANC_ANON_HTTP_TIMEOUT=60
ENABLE_DICOM_WEB=true

# DICOMweb endpoint
AZ_DICOM_ENDPOINT_NAME=
# https://<workspace>-<dicomservicename>-node.dicom.azurehealthcareapis.com/v1/
AZ_DICOM_ENDPOINT_URL=
AZ_DICOM_ENDPOINT_CLIENT_ID=
AZ_DICOM_ENDPOINT_CLIENT_SECRET=
AZ_DICOM_ENDPOINT_TENANT_ID=

# Exposed ports for debugging / testing.
ORTHANC_ANON_DICOM_PORT=XXXX
ORTHANC_ANON_WEB_PORT=YYYY
```

If you don't want to attempt to connect to the azure dicom server, set `AZ_DICOM_ENDPOINT_CLIENT_ID` to an empty string or comment it out.

### Step 2

Start the instance via Docker compose.

### Step 3

If you have chosen to expose the portas, you should now be able to navigate the web interface at `http://localhost:<YYYY>`, supply the chosen credentials and will be presented with the Orthanc web interface:

### Step 4

From the interface, you can view data stored on the instance or perform Query/Retrieves against the Azure DICOM service. Similarly you can target the instance over DIMSE on port `XXXX`, if exposed.

### Step 5

The advanced user interface can be found at `http://localhost:YYYY/ui/app/`. This can be used to check connectivity to the other modalities and the running configuration.

### Step 6

The Azure DICOM service can be accessed via the `DICOMWeb client`:

## Local development

- It is assumed that you will be using docker compose, if not, then you need to mount the contents of the `config` directory onto `/run/secrets` within the container.

## Troubleshooting

- If modifying any of the `.json` configuration files, any typo will cause the instance to fail to
start.
- To use the REST interface, the web port must be exposed.
- To use DIMSE, the DICOM port must be exposed.
- DICOMWeb is enabled on this instance. _Any data pushed to this instance will be anonymised and forwarded via STOW to the configured Azure DICOM service target_.
