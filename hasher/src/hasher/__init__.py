Implements the secure hashing component as a FastAPI application, to be consumed by
the DICOM, EHR & report de-identification components.

The app has a /hash endpoint which expects a message. It uses the Blake2 algorithm to
generate a 64-charcter digest in keyed hashing mode from the message.
The key is stored as a secret in an Azure Key Vault.
The Azure infrastructure (Key Vault, ServicePrincipal & permissions) must be persistent
and instructions are provided for creating these with the az CLI tool.
